                        In order to stop network traffic utilizing unapproved protocols from reaching the product infrastructure, 
                        network access control measures are used. The technical safeguards that have been adopted vary amongst infrastructure providers 
                        and include typical firewall rules, security group assignment, and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) implementations. To safeguard programs that can be accesses through the internet,
                        we have put in place a Web Application Firewall (WAF) solution. The WAF is made to recognize and stop assaults on netwok services that are accessible to the general public.
