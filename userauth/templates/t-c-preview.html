                <p>STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR CONSTRUCTION SERVICES</p>

                        1. ENGAGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE
                        MPTN hereby engages the Contractor, and the Contractor agrees to provide all labor,  materials, equipment, and supervision for a Project as set forth in Attachment A to a PO which shall make specific reference to this  agreement.
                        2. AGREEMENT TIME
                        The Work to be performed pursuant to this Agreement shall be completed pursuant to the time  as set forth in the PO (“Contact Time”). Time is of the essence.
                        3. AGREEMENT SUM.
                        For the completion of the Work by Contractor under this Agreement, MPTN agrees to pay  Contractor the amount as set forth on the PO (“Contract Sum”).
                        4. PAYMENT TERMS
                        4.1 Progress payments shall be made based on the percentage of Work completed, subject to  review and approval by the Authorized MPTN Representative (“AR”). The AR shall be  named on the PO. Pay Applications on the approved MPTN form setting forth the statement  of work completed shall be submitted to the AR for review and approval on a monthly basis.  The Contractor shall, at its own expense, promptly correct Work rejected as provided herein.  In the event that Contractor disputes the determination of the AR then such dispute shall be  subject to mediation as provided herein. Payment of invoices shall be due within thirty (30)  days of approval by the AR. Pending final resolution of an invoice, claim, or other dispute, the  Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of the Work and the MPTN shall  continue to make payments in accordance with this agreement.
                        4.2 If, at any time, Contractor believes that MPTN’s actions result in additional cost or time  not otherwise set forth in the Contract, Contractor must provide written notice within two (2)  days of the event giving rise to the claim describing the basis for the claim and Contractor’s  best current, reasonable cost estimate. Contractor acknowledges that this provision is required to mitigate costs and time impact on performance in MPTN’s best  interests. Contractor’s failure to give timely and complete notice in accordance with this  paragraph will serve as Contractor’s waiver of rights to such claim.
                        4.3 MPTN may withhold no more than ten (10%) percent of the Contract Sum as retainage.  Retainage may be imposed on each invoice.
                        4.4 The Contractor shall notify the AR when the Work is substantially complete. The Work is  substantially complete when the Work is sufficiently complete in accordance with this  Agreement so that the Owner can occupy or utilize the Work for its intended use  (“Substantially Complete”). Upon such notification, the AR shall inspect the Work and shall  develop a punch list of items that do not conform to the requirements of this Agreement.  Upon resolution of any disagreements and upon agreement of a date when all punch list items  will be resolved, the Work may be certified by the AR to be Substantially Complete.
                        4.5 Contractor shall, prior to final payment, provide Payment Certifications on forms  approved by the MPTN and\or such other proof as may be reasonably required by the AR,  that all payrolls, bills for materials and equipment and other indebtedness connected with the  Work for which the MPTN or the property of MPTN might be responsible have been satisfied  by the Contractor.
                        4.6 Acceptance of the final payment shall constitute a full and final waiver of all claims of  Contractor against MPTN for performance of the Work.
                        5. QUALITY OF WORK\WARRANTY
                        MPTN, through its AR, shall have the right to reject any and all Work or services, which it  deems unacceptable in their reasonable determination. Any determination of unacceptable completion of any portion of the Work may be deemed an event of default by MPTN at its  election. All materials furnished by Contractor under this Agreement shall be new and of a  first rate quality. No substitution or alternative materials may be made without the express  written approval of the AR. If, within two (2) years of Substantial Completion of the Work,  any defect in materials or workmanship is discovered by MPTN then Contractor, after  receiving written notice from MPTN of such defect, shall correct it promptly. If Contractor  fails to correct any defect within thirty (30) days following the receipt of written notice by  MPTN, then MPTN may proceed to have such defective work or materials corrected at the  expense of Contractor and Contractor agrees to pay the cost of such protections. The  provisions of this paragraph shall be in addition to any express warranties provided by or  through Contractor for materials delivered to MPTN under this Agreement. All such  warranties are hereby assigned to MPTN and all work performed shall be done in a manner  that shall preserve such warranties. All warranties shall be deemed an integral part of this  Agreement. The Work shall be performed skillfully, carefully, diligently and in a  workmanlike manner and shall be fit for the purpose intended.

                        6. MATERIALS
                        6.1 Contractor shall install only new materials and equipment to be furnished under the  Agreement unless otherwise allowed by MPTN, and that all Work shall be of good quality,  free from faults and defects and in conformance with this Agreement.
                        6.2 In the event the naming of one (1) or more materials or equipment is followed by the  phrase "or approved equal", substitutions of materials or equipment, similar and equal in  quality and utility to the items specifically named, may be made only after written approval by  MPTN. Under no circumstances shall any substitutions requested by Contractor result in any  additional cost to MPTN. Any savings resulting from Contractor including such approved  substitution shall insure to the benefit of MPTN.
                        6.3 Contractor warrants that title to all Work, including but not limited to all materials and  equipment, covered by an Application for Payment shall pass to MPTN, free and clear of all  liens, claims, security interests or encumbrances, and sales tax upon the sooner of the tender  of payment of the applicable Application for Payment by MPTN to Contractor or delivery of  Work to the Job Site; and that no Work, materials or equipment covered by an Application for  Payment shall have been acquired, whether by Contractor or by any other person performing a  portion of the Work or furnishing materials and equipment for the Work, subject to an  agreement under which an interest in or an encumbrance on is retained by the seller or  otherwise imposed by the Contractor or any other person.
                        6.4 The passage of title to MPTN shall not alter or limit the obligations and duties of  Contractor with respect to the Work and the materials or equipment incorporated in or used in  connection with the Work as described in these Contract Documents.
                        7. ACCEPTANCE OF EXISTING CONDITIONS\NOTICE OF DEFECT
                        7.1 Contractor has been given an opportunity to examine the Work site. The Contractor shall  verify the interconnection of its Work with existing or other work as well as site dimensions,  elevations or locations. The exactness of such information or its representation on any  drawings, plans or specifications issued by the MPTN is the responsibility of the Contractor  and is not guaranteed by the MPTN.
                        7.2 In the event that the Contractor discovers any errors, inconsistencies or problems regarding  the drawings, plans or specifications, then the Contractor shall send written notice to the  MPTN detailing such problems and possible solutions.
                            8. COORDINATION OF WORK
                        Contractor shall perform the Work so as to minimize any impact upon the conduct of the  business activities of MPTN. Contractor shall schedule the Work subject to the approval of  MPTN.

                        9. CHANGE ORDERS
                        9.1 No modification to the Work, Contract Sum or Contract Time may be made, nor shall the  scope of the Work be modified, except pursuant to a written Change Order signed by both  Parties. Change Orders shall be effective only upon the issuance of a revised PO by the AR  reflecting the following: a) change in the Work; b) the amount of the adjustment, if any; c) the  Contract Sum; and d) the extent of adjustment, if any in the Contract Time. Changes made without approval as set forth in this paragraph shall be of no force or effect.
                        9.2 MPTN may add to or deduct from the Work by issuing a Directive. A Directive shall  mean a written document containing additions, deletions, revisions, clarifications, or other  written instructions issued by MPTN regarding the performance of the Work. A Directive  shall be signed by the MPTN Authorized Representative. Unless the Directive indicates that it  is for a quote only, Contractor will immediately proceed with the performance of the Scope  Change. Within the time allotted in the Directive or within ten
                        (10) days if no time is set. Contractor will immediately provide, in writing, a reasonable  estimate of the cost and time to complete the Directive or the amount of a reasonable credit  for any reduced scope. MPTN may request that Contractor utilize Unit Prices, if any, to price  the Directive in MPTN’s sole discretion. If the parties agree to the amount of the addition or  deduction, they will each sign a written Change Order to the Contract. If the parties cannot  agree, they will continue to work diligently to resolve the dispute. Unsettled Directives shall  not be incorporated into a Change Order for payment until settlement. Any Directive  undertaken is governed by the terms and conditions of this Contract, as amended by Change  Order.
                        10. RECORD DOCUMENTATION / CLOSEOUT
                        10.1 At the conclusion of the project, the Contractor shall provide a set of “corrected” x reference base drawing plans in a format as provided on the MPTN Record Drawing  Standards (the “Record Drawings'').
                        10.2 The Record Drawings shall reflect all architectural and engineering (all disciplines)  changes that took place during construction and incorporate all field sketches that were  generated. Once the Contractor has completed the preparation of its Record Drawings on the  x-reference provided, the Contractor shall review the Record Drawings for accuracy and  provide its comments to the MPTN and the Architect.
                        10.3 The Contractor will also assist MPTN in reviewing the contract closeout information to  ensure compliance with the requirements of the construction specifications. Such information  will include, but not be limited to: test and balance reports, on-line system diagrams, startup  and shutdown sequences, product manuals, operations and maintenance and spare parts list  and inventories.

                        11. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR
                        Contractor recognizes that it is an independent contractor and will be paid as such. Neither  party shall have the right to bind the other. Contractor will be responsible for all deductions  and/or withholdings for any and all federal or state taxes for itself and its employees. Further,  Contractor recognizes and agrees that as an independent contractor it is not entitled to and will  not raise any issue or defense based upon or related to the sovereign status of MPTN in the  context of third party claims asserted against Contractor or MPTN and related to Contractor’s  performance of services for MPTN under this Contract.
                        12. TAXES
                        MPTN shall be responsible for all applicable taxes for all Work performed to real property  located off the MPTN Reservation. The Contract Sum shall not include any sales or use tax  for work performed on the MPTN Reservation for property intended to be used on the  reservation. Contractor acknowledges that MPTN is generally not subject to most state sales,  use and personal property taxes for materials used on the MPTN Reservation or for services  rendered on the MPTN Reservation. Contractor acknowledges that Connecticut has  established certain reporting and/or registration requirements that must be complied with in  order for the State of Connecticut to acknowledge the tax exempt status of MPTN purchases,  or purchases by Contractor or its subcontractors for MPTN projects. Contractor shall  complete and furnish all necessary reports and forms required by the State of Connecticut  (including but not limited to CERT 128 and CERT 132) to assure that the MPTN exemption is  recognized. Costs and expenses incurred as a result of  Contractor’s failure to meet or exceed Connecticut law.

                        13. INDEMNIFICATION
                        13.1 Each party hereby agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold the other party (including the  indemnitee’s Tribal Council Members, officers, employees, and agents) harmless from and  against any and all claims, suits, damages, awards, losses, fines, liabilities of any nature  arising out of the negligent or willful acts, wrongdoing or omissions of the other including,  without limitation, any of the foregoing as they relate to any and all third parties (including  reasonable attorney’s fees, whether for MPTN staff attorney or outside counsel). The provisions of this subparagraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
                        13.2 Without limiting the indemnification provided by Contractor under this Agreement,  Contractor, at its sole cost and expense, prior to taking any action in connection with this  Agreement, shall procure and, thereafter, shall maintain in full force and effect:

                        14. RISK OF LOSS AND LIABILITY
                        Contractor assumes and shall be solely and exclusively responsible and liable for any and all  loss, costs, expenses, damages, destruction, or injury including, without limitation, bodily  injury or death of any person or persons and damage or destruction of any property or  properties, in connection with Contractor’s performance of its obligations under this  Agreement including, without limitation, any of the foregoing with respect to any equipment  or materials used by Contractor, suppliers or subcontractors in connection with this  Agreement.

                        15. PERMITS AND REGULATIONS
                        Contractor is responsible for meeting all applicable federal, state or local permits for Work  occurring off the MPTN Reservation. Work performed within the boundaries of the  MPTN Reservation Contractor shall obtain MPTN permits and shall conform to MPTN  regulations.
                        16. AUDIT
                        MPTN reserves the right to perform an audit at any time during the term of this Agreement  and up to six (6) years from the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement. The  MPTN reserves the right to conduct an Audit as provided herein irrespective of the lump sum  nature of the contract. The Contractor shall maintain accurate records at all times and shall  continue to maintain such records for six (6) years from the end of this Contract. Upon three  (3) days notice Contractor shall provide MPTN reasonable access to Contractor’s records to  verify that pricing, billing and changes in Work conform to the terms of this Agreement.  MPTN will be permitted to conduct these audits with its own internal resources or by securing  the services of a third party accounting/audit firm, solely at MPTN’s election. MPTN shall  have the right to copy, at its own expense, any record related to the Work performed pursuant  to this Agreement. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the expiration or earlier  termination of this Agreement.
                        17. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
                        17.1 Should MPTN for any reason and at any time in its judgment determine to discontinue  the services of Contractor, MPTN will have the right to terminate this Agreement with or  without cause by issuing a written Notice of Termination. In such event, MPTN will pay  Contractor for reasonable costs incurred and its profits lost thereon for any Work authorized  and performed prior to the termination (unless the reason for the termination is caused by  Contractor’s breach, in which case MPTN has no obligation to pay direct or indirect costs or  lost profit, if any, and may off-set its increased cost to correct or complete the Work from the  Contract Sum, in addition to such other remedies as are provided by law). In no event,  however, shall the amount due Contractor exceed the Contract Sum plus authorized  Reimbursables.
                        17.2 MPTN may, for any reason, suspend the Work for sixty (60) days without any obligation  to pay any indirect costs whatsoever including but not limited to delay, impact, lost  productivity, acceleration, or other such indirect costs, which Contractor may assert to be  associated with such suspension of work.
                        18. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
                        Any Claim arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be subject to mediation as a  condition precedent to the institution of legal or equitable proceedings by either party. The  parties shall endeavor in good faith to resolve their claim(s) by mediation. Mediation shall be conducted so as to minimize impact upon the Contract Time. The Contractor shall  continue to complete the Work as set forth under this Agreement. Litigation shall be stayed  for a period of forty-five (45) days pending the outcome of mediation provided Contractor has  continued to complete the Work and provided that MPTN has continued to pay for Work  performed in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement. Should either party fail to  perform then the mediation requirement may be deemed waived by the performing party. The  parties shall share the mediator’s fee equally. The mediator shall not be called to testify or  otherwise provide evidence by either party in any subsequent legal action. Agreements  reached in mediation shall be enforceable as settlements in any court having jurisdiction  thereof.
                        19. TRIBAL COURT JURISDICTION
                        All claims, disputes or other matters in question between the MPTN and the Contractor  arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, which cannot be resolved  through mediation, shall be heard by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Court (“Tribal Court”),  which shall have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate such disputes. No additional parties shall  be joined to such proceedings without the written consent of MPTN. Nothing in this  Paragraph 19 or in this Agreement shall prohibit or in any way limit MPTN’s right to seek  reimbursement of monies paid for Workers Compensation benefits or Health Benefits,  whether MPTN seeks such reimbursement by intervening in a lawsuit pending in a state or  federal court or by bringing an independent action in any court having jurisdiction thereof,  including state and federal courts.


                        20. SERVICE OF PROCESS
                        MPTN agrees to accept service of process by certified mail at the following address:  The Contractor agrees to accept service of process pursuant to the rules of the Tribal Court at  the mailing address set forth on the PO.
                        21. APPEALS
                        Any award rendered by the Tribal Court may be appealed to the Mashantucket Pequot Court  of Appeals pursuant to applicable rules, and the award rendered by the Mashantucket Pequot  Court of Appeals shall be final. It is the intention of the parties that once a final judgment is  entered by the Tribal Court and/or Tribal Court of Appeals, that judgment may be enforced, if  necessary, in any state or federal court as may be appropriate and in accordance with any  applicable law.

                        22. TAXES, WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION, FRINGE BENEFITS
                        Contractor agrees that it is the Contractor’s legal responsibility to pay all applicable federal,  foreign, state and local income taxes and self-employment taxes with respect to any amounts  received by Contractor (and all personnel hired by Contractor for Contractor’s individual  practice) under the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise required by applicable law,  Owner shall not withhold from the amounts paid to Contractor (or any personnel hired by  Contractor for Contractor’s individual practice) any amounts for federal, foreign or state  income taxes or self-employment taxes. Owner shall not provide any fringe benefits to  Contractor (or any personnel hired by Contractor for Contractor's individual practice)  including, but not limited to, vacation or sick pay, bonuses, life insurance, health insurance, or  retirement benefits. Owner will not cover Contractor (or any personnel hired by Contractor for  Contractor’s individual practice) under state unemployment compensation laws or state  workmen’s compensation laws.
                        23. NEW VENDOR INFORMATION FORM
                        Supplier shall accurately complete and submit, at the direction of the MPTN Procurement  Department, a New Vendor Information Form (“NVIF”). Supplier shall notify MPTN  Procurement, in writing, of any changes in the information supplied on the NVIF. Supplier  shall cooperate in any investigation conducted by the Mashantucket Pequot Gaming  Commission or the Office of the MPTN Inspector General. Failure to abide by the  requirements of this paragraph is an event of default and may result in the immediate  termination of this Agreement.
                        24. MINORITY BUSINESS ENTERPRISES
                        Contractor shall target 15% of all subcontract work, of any tier, to be awarded to Native  American Business Enterprises, Minority Business Enterprises, and\or Woman Owned  Business Enterprises (“MBE”). The Contractor shall report quarterly and shall submit a summary  report prior to final payment in a format as specified by the Purchasing Agent. No price  factoring is to be considered in subcontractor selection. Contractor’s performance regarding  MBE placements will be considered as evaluative criteria for this contract and for future  contract awards. Contractor shall not discriminate against any subcontractors or employee  regarding race, religion, color, sex, age, physical condition or national origin.
                        25. COVENANTS AGAINST KICKBACKS
                        25.1 For purposes of this subsection “Money” means any cash, fee, commission,  credit, gift, gratuity, thing of value or compensation of any kind.
                        25.2 For purposes of this subsection a “Tribal Contract” means a written contract with  the MPTN, Foxwoods, PRxN, or any other political subdivision of the Tribe or with  any Tribally owned business.

                        The Contractor agrees to incorporate all provisions of this Agreement into any and all subcontracts by reference so that these provisions shall apply as if fully incorporated into each  subcontractor contract. The more stringent provisions favoring MPTN shall govern any  inconsistent provisions contained in any subcontractor contract
                        27. ASSIGNMENT
                        Contractor agrees that this Agreement is personal to Contractor and cannot be assigned to any  other party in whole or in part. If a subcontractor is necessary the MPTN requires prior  approval for the use of said subcontractor.

                        Ambiguities, inconsistencies, or conflicts arising out of or related to this Agreement shall not  be strictly construed against MPTN; rather, they shall be resolved by applying the most  reasonable interpretation under the circumstances, giving full consideration to the intentions  of the parties at the time of contracting.
                        30. MPTN’S RIGHT TO CARRY OUT THE WORK
                        If the Contractor defaults, or neglects to carry out the Work in accordance with this  Agreement within a ten (10) day period after receipt of the written notice from the MPTN to  correct such default or neglect, the MPTN may, after such ten day period and without  prejudice to other remedies the MPTN may have, correct such deficiencies. In such case an  appropriate Change Order shall be issued deducting from payments then or thereafter due the Contractor for the reasonable cost of correcting such deficiencies, including MPTN’s  expenses and compensation for additional Work, made necessary by such default, neglect or  failure.
                        31. MODIFICATION
                        This Agreement may be modified only by and with the mutual consent of both parties. Any  modification must be in writing and must be signed by an authorized representative of the  Contractor and by the authorized representative of MPTN.
                        32. EFFECTIVE DATE
                        This Agreement has been entered into as of the day and year as set forth on the PO or upon  the issuance date of the letter to proceed, whichever is earlier.
                        33. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
                        This Agreement and the PO and any attachments thereto issued by MPTN shall constitute the  entire Agreement between Contractor and MPTN. It shall supersede all contracts,  Agreements or understandings between the parties hereto respecting the subject matter  hereof. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement, and any PO, the  terms of the PO shall govern and control.
