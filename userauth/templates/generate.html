        <p>STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR CONSTRUCTION SERVICES</p>

        1. ENGAGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE
        MPTN hereby engages the Contractor, and the Contractor agrees to provide all labor, materials, equipment, and
        supervision for a Project as set forth in Attachment A to a PO which shall make specific reference to this
        agreement.
        2. AGREEMENT TIME
        The Work to be performed pursuant to this Agreement shall be completed pursuant to the time as set forth in the
        PO (“Contact Time”). Time is of the essence.
        3. AGREEMENT SUM.
        For the completion of the Work by Contractor under this Agreement, MPTN agrees to pay Contractor the amount as
        set forth on the PO (“Contract Sum”).
        4. PAYMENT TERMS
        4.1 Progress payments shall be made based on the percentage of Work completed, subject to review and approval by
        the Authorized MPTN Representative (“AR”). The AR shall be named on the PO. Pay Applications on the approved
        MPTN form setting forth the statement of work completed shall be submitted to the AR for review and approval on
        a monthly basis. The Contractor shall, at its own expense, promptly correct Work rejected as provided herein. In
        the event that Contractor disputes the determination of the AR then such dispute shall be subject to mediation
        as provided herein. Payment of invoices shall be due within thirty (30) days of approval by the AR. Pending
        final resolution of an invoice, claim, or other dispute, the Contractor shall proceed diligently with
        performance of the Work and the MPTN shall continue to make payments in accordance with this agreement.
        4.2 If, at any time, Contractor believes that MPTN’s actions result in additional cost or time not otherwise set
        forth in the Contract, Contractor must provide written notice within two (2) days of the event giving rise to
        the claim describing the basis for the claim and Contractor’s best current, reasonable cost estimate. Contractor
        acknowledges that this provision is required to mitigate costs and time impact on performance in MPTN’s best
        interests. Contractor’s failure to give timely and complete notice in accordance with this paragraph will serve
        as Contractor’s waiver of rights to such claim.
        4.3 MPTN may withhold no more than ten (10%) percent of the Contract Sum as retainage. Retainage may be imposed
        on each invoice.
        4.4 The Contractor shall notify the AR when the Work is substantially complete. The Work is substantially
        complete when the Work is sufficiently complete in accordance with this Agreement so that the Owner can occupy
        or utilize the Work for its intended use (“Substantially Complete”). Upon such notification, the AR shall
        inspect the Work and shall develop a punch list of items that do not conform to the requirements of this
        Agreement. Upon resolution of any disagreements and upon agreement of a date when all punch list items will be
        resolved, the Work may be certified by the AR to be Substantially Complete.
        4.5 Contractor shall, prior to final payment, provide Payment Certifications on forms approved by the MPTN
        and\or such other proof as may be reasonably required by the AR, that all payrolls, bills for materials and
        equipment and other indebtedness connected with the Work for which the MPTN or the property of MPTN might be
        responsible have been satisfied by the Contractor.
        4.6 Acceptance of the final payment shall constitute a full and final waiver of all claims of Contractor against
        MPTN for performance of the Work.
        5. QUALITY OF WORK\WARRANTY
        MPTN, through its AR, shall have the right to reject any and all Work or services, which it deems unacceptable
        in their reasonable determination. Any determination of unacceptable completion of any portion of the Work may
        be deemed an event of default by MPTN at its election. All materials furnished by Contractor under this
        Agreement shall be new and of a first rate quality. No substitution or alternative materials may be made without
        the express written approval of the AR. If, within two (2) years of Substantial Completion of the Work, any
        defect in materials or workmanship is discovered by MPTN then Contractor, after receiving written notice from
        MPTN of such defect, shall correct it promptly. If Contractor fails to correct any defect within thirty (30)
        days following the receipt of written notice by MPTN, then MPTN may proceed to have such defective work or
        materials corrected at the expense of Contractor and Contractor agrees to pay the cost of such protections. The
        provisions of this paragraph shall be in addition to any express warranties provided by or through Contractor
        for materials delivered to MPTN under this Agreement. All such warranties are hereby assigned to MPTN and all
        work performed shall be done in a manner that shall preserve such warranties. All warranties shall be deemed an
        integral part of this Agreement. The Work shall be performed skillfully, carefully, diligently and in a
        workmanlike manner and shall be fit for the purpose intended.

        6. MATERIALS
        6.1 Contractor shall install only new materials and equipment to be furnished under the Agreement unless
        otherwise allowed by MPTN, and that all Work shall be of good quality, free from faults and defects and in
        conformance with this Agreement.
        6.2 In the event the naming of one (1) or more materials or equipment is followed by the phrase "or approved
        equal", substitutions of materials or equipment, similar and equal in quality and utility to the items
        specifically named, may be made only after written approval by MPTN. Under no circumstances shall any
        substitutions requested by Contractor result in any additional cost to MPTN. Any savings resulting from
        Contractor including such approved substitution shall insure to the benefit of MPTN.
        6.3 Contractor warrants that title to all Work, including but not limited to all materials and equipment,
        covered by an Application for Payment shall pass to MPTN, free and clear of all liens, claims, security
        interests or encumbrances, and sales tax upon the sooner of the tender of payment of the applicable Application
        for Payment by MPTN to Contractor or delivery of Work to the Job Site; and that no Work, materials or equipment
        covered by an Application for Payment shall have been acquired, whether by Contractor or by any other person
        performing a portion of the Work or furnishing materials and equipment for the Work, subject to an agreement
        under which an interest in or an encumbrance on is retained by the seller or otherwise imposed by the Contractor
        or any other person.
        6.4 The passage of title to MPTN shall not alter or limit the obligations and duties of Contractor with respect
        to the Work and the materials or equipment incorporated in or used in connection with the Work as described in
        these Contract Documents.
        7. ACCEPTANCE OF EXISTING CONDITIONS\NOTICE OF DEFECT
        7.1 Contractor has been given an opportunity to examine the Work site. The Contractor shall verify the
        interconnection of its Work with existing or other work as well as site dimensions, elevations or locations. The
        exactness of such information or its representation on any drawings, plans or specifications issued by the MPTN
        is the responsibility of the Contractor and is not guaranteed by the MPTN.
        7.2 In the event that the Contractor discovers any errors, inconsistencies or problems regarding the drawings,
        plans or specifications, then the Contractor shall send written notice to the MPTN detailing such problems and
        possible solutions.
        8. COORDINATION OF WORK
        Contractor shall perform the Work so as to minimize any impact upon the conduct of the business activities of
        MPTN. Contractor shall schedule the Work subject to the approval of MPTN.

        9. CHANGE ORDERS
        9.1 No modification to the Work, Contract Sum or Contract Time may be made, nor shall the scope of the Work be
        modified, except pursuant to a written Change Order signed by both Parties. Change Orders shall be effective
        only upon the issuance of a revised PO by the AR reflecting the following: a) change in the Work; b) the amount
        of the adjustment, if any; c) the Contract Sum; and d) the extent of adjustment, if any in the Contract Time.
        Changes made without approval as set forth in this paragraph shall be of no force or effect.
        9.2 MPTN may add to or deduct from the Work by issuing a Directive. A Directive shall mean a written document
        containing additions, deletions, revisions, clarifications, or other written instructions issued by MPTN
        regarding the performance of the Work. A Directive shall be signed by the MPTN Authorized Representative. Unless
        the Directive indicates that it is for a quote only, Contractor will immediately proceed with the performance of
        the Scope Change. Within the time allotted in the Directive or within ten
        (10) days if no time is set. Contractor will immediately provide, in writing, a reasonable estimate of the cost
        and time to complete the Directive or the amount of a reasonable credit for any reduced scope. MPTN may request
        that Contractor utilize Unit Prices, if any, to price the Directive in MPTN’s sole discretion. If the parties
        agree to the amount of the addition or deduction, they will each sign a written Change Order to the Contract. If
        the parties cannot agree, they will continue to work diligently to resolve the dispute. Unsettled Directives
        shall not be incorporated into a Change Order for payment until settlement. Any Directive undertaken is governed
        by the terms and conditions of this Contract, as amended by Change Order.
        10. RECORD DOCUMENTATION / CLOSEOUT
        10.1 At the conclusion of the project, the Contractor shall provide a set of “corrected” x reference base
        drawing plans in a format as provided on the MPTN Record Drawing Standards (the “Record Drawings'').
        10.2 The Record Drawings shall reflect all architectural and engineering (all disciplines) changes that took
        place during construction and incorporate all field sketches that were generated. Once the Contractor has
        completed the preparation of its Record Drawings on the x-reference provided, the Contractor shall review the
        Record Drawings for accuracy and provide its comments to the MPTN and the Architect.
        10.3 The Contractor will also assist MPTN in reviewing the contract closeout information to ensure compliance
        with the requirements of the construction specifications. Such information will include, but not be limited to:
        test and balance reports, on-line system diagrams, startup and shutdown sequences, product manuals, operations
        and maintenance and spare parts list and inventories.

        11. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR
        Contractor recognizes that it is an independent contractor and will be paid as such. Neither party shall have
        the right to bind the other. Contractor will be responsible for all deductions and/or withholdings for any and
        all federal or state taxes for itself and its employees. Further, Contractor recognizes and agrees that as an
        independent contractor it is not entitled to and will not raise any issue or defense based upon or related to
        the sovereign status of MPTN in the context of third party claims asserted against Contractor or MPTN and
        related to Contractor’s performance of services for MPTN under this Contract.
        12. TAXES
        MPTN shall be responsible for all applicable taxes for all Work performed to real property located off the MPTN
        Reservation. The Contract Sum shall not include any sales or use tax for work performed on the MPTN Reservation
        for property intended to be used on the reservation. Contractor acknowledges that MPTN is generally not subject
        to most state sales, use and personal property taxes for materials used on the MPTN Reservation or for services
        rendered on the MPTN Reservation. Contractor acknowledges that Connecticut has established certain reporting
        and/or registration requirements that must be complied with in order for the State of Connecticut to acknowledge
        the tax exempt status of MPTN purchases, or purchases by Contractor or its subcontractors for MPTN projects.
        Contractor shall complete and furnish all necessary reports and forms required by the State of Connecticut
        (including but not limited to CERT 128 and CERT 132) to assure that the MPTN exemption is recognized. Costs and
        expenses incurred as a result of Contractor’s failure to meet or exceed Connecticut law.

        13. INDEMNIFICATION
        13.1 Each party hereby agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold the other party (including the indemnitee’s Tribal
        Council Members, officers, employees, and agents) harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, damages,
        awards, losses, fines, liabilities of any nature arising out of the negligent or willful acts, wrongdoing or
        omissions of the other including, without limitation, any of the foregoing as they relate to any and all third
        parties (including reasonable attorney’s fees, whether for MPTN staff attorney or outside counsel). The
        provisions of this subparagraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
        13.2 Without limiting the indemnification provided by Contractor under this Agreement, Contractor, at its sole
        cost and expense, prior to taking any action in connection with this Agreement, shall procure and, thereafter,
        shall maintain in full force and effect:

        14. RISK OF LOSS AND LIABILITY
        Contractor assumes and shall be solely and exclusively responsible and liable for any and all loss, costs,
        expenses, damages, destruction, or injury including, without limitation, bodily injury or death of any person or
        persons and damage or destruction of any property or properties, in connection with Contractor’s performance of
        its obligations under this Agreement including, without limitation, any of the foregoing with respect to any
        equipment or materials used by Contractor, suppliers or subcontractors in connection with this Agreement.

        15. PERMITS AND REGULATIONS
        Contractor is responsible for meeting all applicable federal, state or local permits for Work occurring off the
        MPTN Reservation. Work performed within the boundaries of the MPTN Reservation Contractor shall obtain MPTN
        permits and shall conform to MPTN regulations.
        16. AUDIT
        MPTN reserves the right to perform an audit at any time during the term of this Agreement and up to six (6)
        years from the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement. The MPTN reserves the right to conduct an
        Audit as provided herein irrespective of the lump sum nature of the contract. The Contractor shall maintain
        accurate records at all times and shall continue to maintain such records for six (6) years from the end of this
        Contract. Upon three (3) days notice Contractor shall provide MPTN reasonable access to Contractor’s records to
        verify that pricing, billing and changes in Work conform to the terms of this Agreement. MPTN will be permitted
        to conduct these audits with its own internal resources or by securing the services of a third party
        accounting/audit firm, solely at MPTN’s election. MPTN shall have the right to copy, at its own expense, any
        record related to the Work performed pursuant to this Agreement. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive
        the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.
        17. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
        17.1 Should MPTN for any reason and at any time in its judgment determine to discontinue the services of
        Contractor, MPTN will have the right to terminate this Agreement with or without cause by issuing a written
        Notice of Termination. In such event, MPTN will pay Contractor for reasonable costs incurred and its profits
        lost thereon for any Work authorized and performed prior to the termination (unless the reason for the
        termination is caused by Contractor’s breach, in which case MPTN has no obligation to pay direct or indirect
        costs or lost profit, if any, and may off-set its increased cost to correct or complete the Work from the
        Contract Sum, in addition to such other remedies as are provided by law). In no event, however, shall the amount
        due Contractor exceed the Contract Sum plus authorized Reimbursables.
        17.2 MPTN may, for any reason, suspend the Work for sixty (60) days without any obligation to pay any indirect
        costs whatsoever including but not limited to delay, impact, lost productivity, acceleration, or other such
        indirect costs, which Contractor may assert to be associated with such suspension of work.
        18. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
        Any Claim arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be subject to mediation as a condition precedent to
        the institution of legal or equitable proceedings by either party. The parties shall endeavor in good faith to
        resolve their claim(s) by mediation. Mediation shall be conducted so as to minimize impact upon the Contract
        Time. The Contractor shall continue to complete the Work as set forth under this Agreement. Litigation shall be
        stayed for a period of forty-five (45) days pending the outcome of mediation provided Contractor has continued
        to complete the Work and provided that MPTN has continued to pay for Work performed in compliance with the
        requirements of this Agreement. Should either party fail to perform then the mediation requirement may be deemed
        waived by the performing party. The parties shall share the mediator’s fee equally. The mediator shall not be
        called to testify or otherwise provide evidence by either party in any subsequent legal action. Agreements
        reached in mediation shall be enforceable as settlements in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
        19. TRIBAL COURT JURISDICTION
        All claims, disputes or other matters in question between the MPTN and the Contractor arising out of or relating
        to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, which cannot be resolved through mediation, shall be heard by the
        Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Court (“Tribal Court”), which shall have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate such
        disputes. No additional parties shall be joined to such proceedings without the written consent of MPTN. Nothing
        in this Paragraph 19 or in this Agreement shall prohibit or in any way limit MPTN’s right to seek reimbursement
        of monies paid for Workers Compensation benefits or Health Benefits, whether MPTN seeks such reimbursement by
        intervening in a lawsuit pending in a state or federal court or by bringing an independent action in any court
        having jurisdiction thereof, including state and federal courts.


        20. SERVICE OF PROCESS
        MPTN agrees to accept service of process by certified mail at the following address: The Contractor agrees to
        accept service of process pursuant to the rules of the Tribal Court at the mailing address set forth on the PO.
        21. APPEALS
        Any award rendered by the Tribal Court may be appealed to the Mashantucket Pequot Court of Appeals pursuant to
        applicable rules, and the award rendered by the Mashantucket Pequot Court of Appeals shall be final. It is the
        intention of the parties that once a final judgment is entered by the Tribal Court and/or Tribal Court of
        Appeals, that judgment may be enforced, if necessary, in any state or federal court as may be appropriate and in
        accordance with any applicable law.

        22. TAXES, WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION, FRINGE BENEFITS
        Contractor agrees that it is the Contractor’s legal responsibility to pay all applicable federal, foreign, state
        and local income taxes and self-employment taxes with respect to any amounts received by Contractor (and all
        personnel hired by Contractor for Contractor’s individual practice) under the terms of this Agreement. Unless
        otherwise required by applicable law, Owner shall not withhold from the amounts paid to Contractor (or any
        personnel hired by Contractor for Contractor’s individual practice) any amounts for federal, foreign or state
        income taxes or self-employment taxes. Owner shall not provide any fringe benefits to Contractor (or any
        personnel hired by Contractor for Contractor's individual practice) including, but not limited to, vacation or
        sick pay, bonuses, life insurance, health insurance, or retirement benefits. Owner will not cover Contractor (or
        any personnel hired by Contractor for Contractor’s individual practice) under state unemployment compensation
        laws or state workmen’s compensation laws.
        23. NEW VENDOR INFORMATION FORM
        Supplier shall accurately complete and submit, at the direction of the MPTN Procurement Department, a New Vendor
        Information Form (“NVIF”). Supplier shall notify MPTN Procurement, in writing, of any changes in the information
        supplied on the NVIF. Supplier shall cooperate in any investigation conducted by the Mashantucket Pequot Gaming
        Commission or the Office of the MPTN Inspector General. Failure to abide by the requirements of this paragraph
        is an event of default and may result in the immediate termination of this Agreement.
        24. MINORITY BUSINESS ENTERPRISES
        Contractor shall target 15% of all subcontract work, of any tier, to be awarded to Native American Business
        Enterprises, Minority Business Enterprises, and\or Woman Owned Business Enterprises (“MBE”). The Contractor
        shall report quarterly and shall submit a summary report prior to final payment in a format as specified by the
        Purchasing Agent. No price factoring is to be considered in subcontractor selection. Contractor’s performance
        regarding MBE placements will be considered as evaluative criteria for this contract and for future contract
        awards. Contractor shall not discriminate against any subcontractors or employee regarding race, religion,
        color, sex, age, physical condition or national origin.
        25. COVENANTS AGAINST KICKBACKS
        25.1 For purposes of this subsection “Money” means any cash, fee, commission, credit, gift, gratuity, thing of
        value or compensation of any kind.
        25.2 For purposes of this subsection a “Tribal Contract” means a written contract with the MPTN, Foxwoods, PRxN,
        or any other political subdivision of the Tribe or with any Tribally owned business.
        25.3 For purposes of this subsection a “Kickback” means any Money which is provided or is offered, as herein
        provided, for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining a Tribal Contract or for rewarding favorable treatment in
        connection with any Tribal Contract.

        25.4 Supplier represents, warrants, covenants and agrees that neither Supplier nor its affiliates or any
        subcontractors (including any of their officers or employees) has provided or attempted to provide, either
        directly or indirectly, any Kickback to any employee of the MPTN or to any member of the Tribe. Supplier further
        warrants, covenants and agrees that neither Supplier nor its affiliates nor any subcontractors (including any of
        their officers or employees) will, in the future, provide or attempt to provide, either directly or indirectly,
        any Kickback to any employee of the MPTN or to any member of the Tribe.
        25.5 Failure to abide by the provisions of this section may, without further notice, result in the immediate
        termination of this Agreement.
        26. INCORPORATION OF AGREEMENT TERMS INTO SUBCONTRACTOR AGREEMENTS
        The Contractor agrees to incorporate all provisions of this Agreement into any and all subcontracts by reference
        so that these provisions shall apply as if fully incorporated into each subcontractor contract. The more
        stringent provisions favoring MPTN shall govern any inconsistent provisions contained in any subcontractor
        contract
        27. ASSIGNMENT
        Contractor agrees that this Agreement is personal to Contractor and cannot be assigned to any other party in
        whole or in part. If a subcontractor is necessary the MPTN requires prior approval for the use of said
        subcontractor.
        28. INTERPRETATION
        Ambiguities, inconsistencies, or conflicts arising out of or related to this Agreement shall not be strictly
        construed against MPTN; rather, they shall be resolved by applying the most reasonable interpretation under the
        circumstances, giving full consideration to the intentions of the parties at the time of contracting.
        30. MPTN’S RIGHT TO CARRY OUT THE WORK
        If the Contractor defaults, or neglects to carry out the Work in accordance with this Agreement within a ten
        (10) day period after receipt of the written notice from the MPTN to correct such default or neglect, the MPTN
        may, after such ten day period and without prejudice to other remedies the MPTN may have, correct such
        deficiencies. In such case an appropriate Change Order shall be issued deducting from payments then or
        thereafter due the Contractor for the reasonable cost of correcting such deficiencies, including MPTN’s expenses
        and compensation for additional Work, made necessary by such default, neglect or failure.
        31. MODIFICATION

        the letter to proceed, whichever is earlier.
        33. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
        This Agreement and the PO and any attachments thereto issued by MPTN shall constitute the entire Agreement
        between Contractor and MPTN. It shall supersede all contracts, Agreements or understandings between the parties
        hereto respecting the subject matter hereof. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement,
        and any PO, the terms of the PO shall govern and control.
        34. OFFICIAL ADDRESS
        Seller recognizes that Mashantucket is a separate and sovereign jurisdiction and as such that the correct
        addresses will be appropriately utilized for all shipments and communications in the course of doing business
        with each of Buyer’s properties, as well as the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation. Seller agrees to reflect (as
        appropriate) Buyer’s addresses as follows:

                    personalised offer letters which give further details relating to employment, including job title,
                    grade, rate of pay, hours of work and date of commencement of duties including continuous employment
                    date.
                    2 Job description
                    2.1 All staff should have a job description for their post which will be provided on joining the
                    University. Job descriptions will not be regarded as precise or exhaustive specifications of duties
                    and responsibilities but as a guide to accountabilities associated with the role. Staff will also
                    carry out such additional or alternative tasks as the University may from time to time reasonably
                    require, and be required to participate in any training deemed necessary by the University to
                    properly perform their duties.
                    3 Continuous employment
                    3.1 Any previous periods of employment with the University, or a previous employer e.g. NHS Trusts,
                    which are to be included in the period of continuous service, will be referred to in personalised
                    offer letters.
                    3.2 For staff transferring directly from another university within the European Economic Area,
                    previous service will be recognised by the University for the purpose of calculating maternity
                    benefit. For all other contractual and statutory purposes, the period of continuous employment for
                    statutory purposes will begin on their start date with the University of Bristol.
                    4 Salary
                    4.1 Basic salary accrues from day to day and is payable monthly by credit transfer into a member of
                    staff’s nominated bank/building society account normally on 26th day of each calendar month, subject
                    to the deduction of tax, national insurance and any other agreed or lawfully required deductions,
                    including the deduction of pension contributions where appropriate.
                    4.2 The University operates a Pension Salary Exchange scheme for eligible staff in the University of
                    Bristol Group Pension Plan (UBGPP), University of Bristol Pension Scheme (UBPAS) and Universities
                    Superannuation Scheme (USS). Under the rules of the Pension Salary Exchange scheme, who become
                    members of UBGPP, UBPAS and USS, and who are eligible to participate in Pension Salary Exchange,
                    will be automatically enrolled in the arrangements unless they opt out. Please refer to the Pension
                    Salary Exchange Scheme at http://www.bris.ac.uk/hr/salaries/sal-exchange/ for further information.
                    Where staff are in the Pension Salary Exchange scheme, the University will use the term “Reference
                    Pay” to mean basic salary before taking account of any Pension Salary Exchange. Where staff are
                    entitled to additional pay for overtime working, shift allowances, on-call, or similar pay
                    supplements, these will be calculated on the basis of Reference Pay.
                    4.3 The University’s Pay Spine is reviewed annually, and any changes will normally take effect from
                    1 August of each calendar year.
                    4.4 With the exception Associate Professors and Grade M staff, all other staff will progress
                    annually on the relevant incremental date to the top service increment point on their grade, except
                    where unsatisfactory performance has already been established through the operation of the
                    Capability Procedure.
                    4.5 Associate Professors and Grade M staff will not be eligible for annual incremental progression,
                    but rather, incremental progression will be determined on the basis of personal performance.
                    5 Deductions
                    5.1 In accordance with the Employment Rights Act 1996, the University is authorised to deduct from a
                    member of staff’s remuneration, any sums that are due from them including any overpayments, loans or
                    advances made to them by the University and any overpayments in respect of annual leave taken in
                    excess of a member of staff’s entitlement. No deductions will be made without prior notification to
                    the individual.
                    6 Place of work
                    6.1 A member of staff’s normal place of work will be such sites of the University and associated NHS
                    Trusts as are requested, but the University reserves the right to require staff to work temporarily
                    or permanently at such other place of work or location as the University may reasonably require. In
                    the course of a member of staff’s duties they may also be required to travel throughout the UK and
                    overseas.
                    7 Sickness
                    7.1 If staff are unable to attend for work due to illness or other incapacity, they (or someone on
                    their behalf) must notify the University by telephone as soon as possible (normally by 10.00 a.m.)
                    on their first working day of absence. Staff must state the reason for absence and the date on which
                    they expect to return and/or agree when they will next be in contact with further information.
                    On a member of staff’s return they must submit a self-certification form to the University
                    explaining the cause of their sickness absence. If the absence lasts for eight consecutive days or
                    more (including weekends) they must submit a fit note (issued by certain healthcare professionals)
                    to the University. Further fit notes will be required to cover the total period of absence. It is
                    the member of staff’s responsibility to keep the University informed about their progress and their
                    likely date of return.
                    7.2 The University will normally pay sick pay during sickness absence in accordance with the
                    following arrangements from the first day of absence.
                    Length of Service Full Pay Half Pay
                    First 3 months of service 2 weeks 2 weeks
                    Remaining 9 months of first year of service 9 weeks 9 weeks
                    Second and third year of service 13 weeks 13 weeks
                    Fourth and fifth year of service 22 weeks 22 weeks
                    After fifth year of service 26 weeks 26 weeks
                    7.3 The University reserves the right to withhold University sick pay where a member of staff fails
                    to comply with the proper notification requirements, or if, after full investigation and due
                    process, the University considers that a member of staff is abusing the University sick pay scheme.
                    7.4 University sick pay shall mean a member of staff’s normal rate of pay. Any Statutory Sick Pay
                    (SSP) entitlement shall be included in full pay but paid in addition to half pay.
                    7.5 The University reserves the right to terminate employment provided due notice has been given in
                    accordance with Ordinance 10, section 7 on ill health, at any stage during or after payment of sick
                    pay.
                    7.6 For the purpose of calculating entitlement to sick pay the period of service shall be the period
                    of continuous service from the date of appointment to the first day of absence. If a break in
                    continuous service occurs due to resignation and re-employment, the effective period of service for
                    calculating the allowance due will run from the date of re-appointment.
                    7.7 Entitlement to sick pay is calculated on the basis of length of service as of the first day of
                    absence. Deductions will be made for any days of paid sickness absence occurring during the 12
                    months preceding the first day of their current period of absence.
                    7.8 The University shall have sole discretion in appropriate cases to extend the period of paid sick
                    leave.
                    7.9 If sickness absence is caused by the actionable negligence of a third party in respect of which
                    damages are recoverable then any sums paid by the University shall constitute loans to that member
                    of staff, who shall:
                    a. forthwith notify the University of all the relevant circumstances and of any claim, compromise,
                    settlement or judgement made or awarded in connection therewith;
                    b. if the University requires a refund of such sums as the University may determine, not exceeding
                    whichever is the lower of:
                    i. the amount of damages recovered under any compromise, settlement or judgement; and
                    ii. the sums advanced in respect of the period of incapacity.
                    7.10 The University reserves the right to require staff to undergo a medical examination at any time
                    (at the University’s expense) by a doctor or other medical practitioner nominated by the University.
                    Staff agree to give such authority as is required for the University’s appointed doctor to disclose
                    to the University the relevant findings of such an examination.
                    7.11 After any period of sickness, and before the University allows a return to work, a member of
                    staff may be required to provide a medical certificate or other written confirmation from a
                    registered medical practitioner that they are fit to return to work. The University reserves the
                    right to refuse to allow a member of staff to return to work until they have complied with such
                    requirement.
                    Term-time only staff
                    7.12 Contracted term-time only Staff qualify for University sick pay on a pro rata basis.
                    7.13 Term-time only staff are entitled to sick pay only for those periods when they would otherwise
                    have been at work. Entitlement to sick pay will cease on the last day of any given working period,
                    and where appropriate, will recommence at the start of the next.
                    7.14 In calculating entitlement to sick pay, a term-time only member of staff’s length of service is
                    regarded as continuous from their date of commencement, including periods of vacation.
                    8 Expenses
                    8.1 The University shall reimburse staff for all expenses wholly and necessarily incurred by them in
                    the proper performance of their duties, subject to their compliance with any policy or procedure in
                    relation to expenses that the University may issue from time to time and their production of such
                    evidence as to expenses as the University may require.
                    8.2 If staff travel abroad as part of their duties, they are required to take out full medical
                    insurance. Staff should contact the University Insurance Officer, prior to departure, to arrange
                    cover. Only insurance arranged under the University Scheme is reimbursable.
                    9 Confidentiality
                    9.1 Members of staff must not, either during their employment or at any time after the termination
                    of their employment, disclose any trade secrets or other confidential information relating to the
                    University or any of its activities including those in respect of which the University owes an
                    obligation of confidence to any third party.
                    9.2 “Confidential Information” means trade secrets and details of and information relating to
                    employees, students of the University, matters of Health and Safety (including the University’s
                    disaster plan), and any information, the release of which would damage the University’s commercial
                    interests, endanger staff or students together with any information that is legally privileged. It
                    also means any information which they are told is confidential, any information that is treated as
                    confidential and any information in respect of which the University has a duty of confidentiality to
                    a third party including patients. Confidential Information also includes any and all information
                    which the University is not obliged to release under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (the Act)
                    and where a member of staff is uncertain whether a piece of information falls within the Act they
                    will not disclose such information unless and until they have received advice from the University’s
                    Information Rights Manager or other member of the University Secretariat.
                    9.3 Staff agree that during their employment they will:
                    a. not without proper authority remove from the University’s premises, any confidential information
                    b. if the University requests, electronically delete or otherwise destroy all confidential
                    information in their possession or under their control and destroy all other documents and tangible
                    items (including back-ups and/or extracts of them) in their possession or under their control which
                    contain or refer to any confidential information.
                    9.4 Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude a member of staff from making a protected disclosure in
                    accordance with the provisions set out in the Employment Rights Act 1996.
                    10 University property
                    10.1 Any property of the University shall remain the property of the University (except for
                    intellectual property belonging to a member of staff under clause 11) and shall be handed over by
                    staff to the University on demand and in any event on the termination of employment.
                    11 Intellectual property rights
                    Patents
                    11.1 As between a member of staff and the University, the ownership of all inventions made by the
                    member of staff will be determined in accordance with section 39 of the Patents Act 1977. If at any
                    time during their appointment a member of staff (whether alone or with any other person or persons)
                    make an invention, they shall promptly disclose to the University full details, including drawings
                    and models, of such invention to enable the University to determine whether the invention belongs to
                    the University. If the invention does not belong to the University by reasons of the Patents Act
                    1977, the University shall treat all information disclosed to it by the member of staff as
                    confidential information and the property of the member of staff. If the invention does belong to
                    the University, the member of staff shall do all things necessary or desirable to enable the
                    University, or its nominee, to obtain the benefit of the invention and to secure patent or other
                    appropriate forms of protection for it throughout the world.
                    11.2 In the best interests of the individual and the University formal arrangements should be agreed
                    relating to such commercial exploitation and any financial benefit arising, and if appropriate be
                    subject to the terms of any relevant research grant.
                    11.3 Each case will need to be considered in the light of the individual circumstances applying, for
                    example, the balance between University time and resources and those privately invested by the
                    individual concerned. Subject to variation depending upon the circumstances, normally the
                    apportionment of income deriving from such commercial exploitation will be on the following scale:
                    i. The first call on income is a payment to the individual(s) involved of up to £4,000 (this should
                    be viewed as an advance allocation of part of the share of the first £15,000 (net of University
                    outgoings) received):
                    Income £0 gross - £4,000 gross: 100% to the individual(s)
                    ii. The next call on income is the recovery of all outgoings by the University; for example patent
                    and legal costs, thus reducing the gross income to a net sum.
                    iii. Further income, received after the initial payment of £4,000 has been made and after the
                    recovery of University outgoings, is apportioned as follows:
                    Income Apportionment
                    £0 - £15,000 net 70% to individual(s)
                    15% to host Department
                    15% to University
                    (Assuming net income of £15,000 has been received, the individual(s) will receive a total of £10,500
                    which includes the initial payment of £4,000.)
                    £15,000 - £75,000 net 50% to individual(s)
                    25% to host Department
                    25% to University
                    Greater than £75,000 net 1/3rd to individual(s)
                    1/3rd to host Department
                    1/3rd to University
                    11.4 Any payments to individual(s) must take account of both employees' and employer's national
                    insurance contributions. Thus in case i) the £4000 is a gross sum, from which any employer's
                    national insurance contribution should be taken prior to payment. This calculation of national
                    insurance contribution applies to all other payments to individual(s) under scenarios ii) and iii).
                    Copyright and Design
                    11.5 Members of staff shall promptly notify the University of all copyright works (including
                    computer software) and all designs (whether registered or unregistered) made, whether alone or with
                    others, in the course of employment. Under the provisions of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
                    1988 and the Registered Designs Act 1949, as amended, the rights in such works or designs shall
                    normally be the property of the University. In the case of the commercial exploitation of copyright
                    works (including computer software) and designs (whether registered or unregistered) made in the
                    course of employment, members of staff are required to consult with the University in order that
                    appropriate arrangements are agreed. The University may not always seek to benefit from any rights
                    in copyright works and designs which it may have as employer.
                    11.6 Notification by members of staff of possible patents, copyright and designs shall be through
                    their Head of Department to the Research and Enterprise Development Office and University Secretary.
                    In relation to entering into any contracts with outside bodies on behalf of the University, members
                    of staff must consult through their Head of Department with the Registrar and the Research and
                    Enterprise Development Office.
                    12 Workwear and equipment
                    12.1 If staff are issued with workwear or equipment they:
                    a. must ensure that they use it whenever necessary, or as required, and in accordance with the
                    University’s Health and Safety Policy; and
                    b. must tell the University as soon as it needs replacing whether due to damage, defect or for any
                    other reasons.
                    13 Interception of communications
                    13.1 Under the provisions of The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, The General Data
                    Protection Regulation (Data Protection Act 2018), The Telecommunications (Lawful Business Practice)
                    (Interception of Communications) Regulations 2000 and any other relevant legislation in force from

                        <p>
                            1. TERM OF AGREEMENT.
                            I understand that the terms and conditions in this outpatient agreement will remain in
                            effect for one year from the date of signature and that I will be asked to sign this
                            agreement annually. I understand I will be asked to confirm that my demographic and
                            insurance information is correct at each clinic visit. If my insurance or demographic
                            information has changed, I will inform the clinic staff.
                            2. MEDICAL CONSENT.
                            I, the undersigned patient or legal representative, consent to the general treatment and
                            procedures that may be performed. These procedures may include but are not limited to
                            laboratory procedures, x-ray examinations, medical or surgical treatment or procedures
                            provided to the patient under the general and special instructions of the patient’s
                            physician or surgeon. I understand that it is the responsibility of the patient’s physician
                            to obtain the patient’s informed consent when required for specific medical or surgical
                            treatment and special diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. I understand and agree that at
                            the request of the attending physician, health practitioners (such as physician assistants
                            and nurse practitioners) may participate in the patient’s care.
                            A. Terms and conditions related to the provision of health care: 1. For the purpose of
                            providing Healthcare, the Patient shall book the term of treatment at the Provider by
                            telephone, in person or via an electronic form on the Provider’s website. The booked term is
                            binding for the Provider as well as for the Patient. The patient is entitled at any time, no
                            later than 24 hours before the booked term, to cancel it or to book another possible term.
                            In the case of Patients who have planned extractions or implants, it is necessary to inform
                            the Provider about the cancellation of the term no later than 48 hours before it is booked.
                            The ordered date can be re-ordered only once. The provider reserves the right to provide the
                            patient with another date only after payment for treatment in advance by online payment.
                            2. If the Patient has a valid and effective Agreement with the Provider and has paid the
                            Provider the relevant membership fee in accordance with the Agreement, he/she is entitled to
                            discounts and benefits arising from the Agreement within the relevant Service Package, which
                            he has freely chosen.
                            3. Prior to the start of treatment, the attending healthcare professional is obliged to
                            inform the Patient about the purpose, nature, possible consequences, options for the
                            proposed procedures, as well as the risks of refusing to provide Healthcare in accordance
                            with provision 6 of the Healthcare Act. The healthcare professional is obliged to provide
                            instruction discreetly, clearly, intelligibly and without coercion, so that the Patient has
                            sufficient time to freely decide on informed consent.
                            4. The patient has the right to humane and dignified approach from healthcare professionals,
                            protection of dignity and physical and mental integrity.
                            5. The patient also has the right to maintain the confidentiality of the Healthcare
                            Professionals regarding all data concerning his health condition.
                            6. The Provider has the right to refuse to treat the Patient in case of a detected medical
                            contraindication due to the nature of the provided Healthcare and the Patient’s Health
                            condition, on any day, as well as the day when he arrived for treatment.
                            7. The Provider also reserves the right to refuse to treat a patient who appears to be under
                            the influence of alcohol, other narcotics or psychotropic substances, behaves vulgarly or
                            aggressively, disrupts the smooth running of the clinic and the provision of health care, or
                            otherwise endangers or disrupts clinic staff or other patients.
                            8. The Provider provides Health Care exclusively at the times defined by the Provider.
                            9. The Provider is obliged to provide an extract from the Medical Documentation to the
                            extent directly related to the purpose of the request, on the basis of a written request, to
                            another Provider or another person in accordance with the Health Care Act.
                            10. Undergraduate and doctoral students, participants in language courses and holders of
                            admission notices entitling them to study at a higher education institution, who are proven
                            to be in further education or training.
                            11. Health services, goods and facilities must be provided to all patients without any
                            discrimination. Non-discrimination is a key principle in human rights and is crucial to the
                            enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of health.
                            12. All services, goods and facilities must be available, accessible, acceptable and of good
                            quality.
                            13. Functioning public health and health-care facilities, goods and services must be
                            available in sufficient quantity.
                            14. They must be accessible physically (in safe reach for all sections of the population,
                            including children, adolescents, older persons, persons with disabilities and other
                            vulnerable groups) as well as financially and on the basis of non-discrimination.
                            Accessibility also implies the right to seek, receive and impart health-related information
                            in an accessible format (for all, including persons with disabilities), but does not impair
                            the right to have personal health data treated confidentially.
                            15. The facilities, goods and services should also respect medical ethics, and be
                            gender-sensitive and culturally appropriate. In other words, they should be medically and
                            culturally acceptable.
                            We may use and disclose medical information about you for the following purposes:
                            ● To provide you with medical treatment and services;
                            ● To bill and receive payment for the treatment and services you receive; ● For functions
                            necessary to run the Clinic and assure that our patients receive quality care;
                            ● To participate in research studies, subject to certain requirements; and ● As required or
                            permitted by law. There are additional situations where we may disclose medical information
                            about you without authorization, such as:
                            ● For public health activities (e.g., reporting abuse or reactions to Medications); ● To a
                            health oversight agency, such as the Nigeria Department of Health Services; ● In response to
                            a court or administrative order, subpoena warrant or similar process; ● To law enforcement
                            officials in certain limited circumstances;
                            ● To a coroner, medical examiner or funeral director; and
                            ● To organizations that handle organ, eye, or tissue procurement or transplantation.
                            Applied rules for these categories of patients:
                            1. Ineligible patient: Healthcare should be provided to a person incapable of giving
                            informed consent. A legal representative acts on behalf of an ineligible patient. 2. A
                            minor: a person deprived of legal capacity and a person with limited legal capacity are
                            considered to be incapable of giving informed consent.
                            3. Persons with disabilities
                            ● The right to health of persons with disabilities cannot be achieved in isolation. It is
                            closely linked to non-discrimination and other principles of individual autonomy,
                            participation and social inclusion, respect for difference, accessibility, as well as
                            equality of opportunity and respect for the evolving capacities of children.
                            ● The newly adopted Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires States to
                            promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental
                            freedoms by persons with disabilities, including their right to health, and to promote
                            respect for their inherent dignity
                            ● Importantly, States must require health professionals to provide care of the same quality
                            to persons with disabilities as to others, including on the basis of free and informed
                            consent
                            ● The Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 23) recognizes the right of children with

                                    and under any applicable law].
                                    7.3 The Provider shall create a back-up copy of [the Customer Data] at least
                                    [daily], shall ensure that each such copy is sufficient to [enable the Provider to
                                    restore the Hosted Services to the state they were in at the time the back-up was
                                    taken], and shall [retain and securely store each such copy for a minimum period of
                                    30 days].

                                    Provider in accordance with Clause 7.3]. The Customer acknowledges that this process
                                    will overwrite the Customer Data stored on the Platform prior to the restoration.
                                    8. Mobile App
                                    8.1 The parties acknowledge and agree that the use of the Mobile App, the parties'

                                    of either party arising out of the use of the Mobile App shall be subject to
                                    separate terms and conditions, and accordingly this Agreement shall not govern any

                                    before performing Services that result in any estimate of time-based Charges given
                                    to the Customer being exceeded or any budget for time-based Charges agreed by the
                                    parties being exceeded; and unless the Customer agrees otherwise in writing, the
                                    Customer shall not be liable to pay to the Provider any Charges in respect of

                                    Customer not less than [30 days'] written notice of the variation[ expiring on [any
                                    anniversary of the date of execution of this Agreement]][, providing that no such
                                    variation shall constitute a percentage increase in [the relevant element of the
                                    Charges] that exceeds[ [2]% over] the percentage increase, since the date of the

                                    10.4] (or, if no such variation has occurred, since the date of execution of this
                                    Agreement), in [the Retail Prices Index (all items) published by the UK Office for

                                    particulars)].
                                    11.2 The Customer must pay the Charges to the Provider within the period of [30
                                    days] following [the issue of an invoice in accordance with this Clause 11] OR [the
                                    receipt of an invoice issued in accordance with this Clause 11][, providing that the
                                    Charges must in all cases be paid before the commencement of the period to which
                                    they relate].

                                    above the Bank of England base rate from time to time] (which interest will accrue
                                    daily until the date of actual payment and be compounded at the end of each calendar
                                    month); or
                                    (b) claim interest and statutory compensation from the Customer pursuant to the Late

                                    12.1 The Provider must:
                                    (a) keep the Customer Confidential Information strictly confidential;
                                    (b) not disclose the Customer Confidential Information to any person without the
                                    Customer's prior written consent[, and then only under conditions of confidentiality
                                    [approved in writing by the Customer] OR [no less onerous than those contained in
                                    this Agreement]];
                                    (c) use the same degree of care to protect the confidentiality of the Customer
                                    Confidential Information as the Provider uses to protect the Provider's own
                                    confidential information of a similar nature, being at least a reasonable degree of
                                    care;
                                    (d) [act in good faith at all times in relation to the Customer Confidential
                                    Information]; and
                                    (e) [not use any of the Customer Confidential Information for any purpose other than
                                    [specify purposes]].
                                    12.2 Notwithstanding Clause 12.1, the Provider may disclose the Customer
                                    Confidential Information to the Provider's [officers, employees, professional
                                    advisers, insurers, agents and subcontractors] [who have a need to access the
                                    Customer Confidential Information for the performance of their work with respect to

                                    to protect the confidentiality of the Customer Confidential Information.
                                    12.3 This Clause 12 imposes no obligations upon the Provider with respect to
                                    Customer Confidential Information that:

                                    subject to any other obligation of confidentiality;
                                    (b) is or becomes publicly known through no act or default of the Provider; or
                                    (c) [is obtained by the Provider from a third party in circumstances where the
                                    Provider has no reason to believe that there has been a breach of an obligation of
                                    confidentiality].
                                    12.4 The restrictions in this Clause 12 do not apply to the extent that any Customer
                                    Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by any law or regulation, by
                                    any judicial or governmental order or request, or pursuant to disclosure
                                    requirements relating to the listing of the stock of the Provider on any recognised
                                    stock exchange.
                                    12.5 The provisions of this Clause 12 shall continue in force [indefinitely
                                    following the termination of this Agreement] OR [for a period of [5 years] following
                                    the termination of this Agreement, at the end of which period they will cease to

                                    changes before their implementation, then [the Provider must not implement the
                                    changes] OR [the Customer may terminate this Agreement on [7 days'] written notice
                                    to the Provider, providing that such notice must be given within the period of [7

                                    may subcontract [to any reputable third party hosting business the hosting of the
                                    Platform and the provision of services in relation to the support and maintenance of

                                    22.1 No breach of any provision of this Agreement shall be waived except with the
                                    express written consent of the party not in breach.
                                    22.2 If any provision of this Agreement is determined by any court or other
                                    competent authority to be unlawful and/or unenforceable, the other provisions of
                                    this Agreement will continue in effect. If any unlawful and/or unenforceable
                                    provision would be lawful or enforceable if part of it were deleted, that part will
                                    be deemed to be deleted, and the rest of the provision will continue in effect
                                    (unless that would contradict the clear intention of the parties, in which case the
                                    entirety of the relevant provision will be deemed to be deleted).
                                    22.3 This Agreement may not be varied except by a written document signed by or on
                                    behalf of each of the parties.
                                    22.4 Neither party may without the prior written consent of the other party assign,
                                    transfer, charge, license or otherwise deal in or dispose of any contractual rights
                                    or obligations under this Agreement.
                                    22.5 This Agreement is made for the benefit of the parties, and is not intended to
                                    benefit any third party or be enforceable by any third party. The rights of the
                                    parties to terminate, rescind, or agree to any amendment, waiver, variation or
                                    settlement under or relating to this Agreement are not subject to the consent of any
                                    third party.
                                    22.6 Subject to Clause 16.1, this Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement
                                    between the parties in relation to the subject matter of this Agreement, and shall
                                    supersede all previous agreements, arrangements and understandings between the
                                    parties in respect of that subject matter.
                                    22.7 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with [English
                                    law].
                                    22.8 The courts of [England] shall have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any
                                    dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement.
                                    23. Interpretation

                                    (b) any subordinate legislation made under that statute or statutory provision.
                                    23.2 The Clause headings do not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.
                                    23.3 References in this Agreement to "calendar months" are to [the 12 named periods
                                    (January, February and so on) into which a year is divided].
                                    23.4 In this Agreement, general words shall not be given a restrictive
                                    interpretation by reason of being preceded or followed by words indicating a
                                    particular class of acts, matters or things.

                                    Optional element.
                                    Clause 12.1
                                    ● In the event of a disclosure of confidential information made by the first party
                                    with the prior written consent of the second party, should the first party be bound
                                    to place confidentiality obligations upon the recipient of the information?
                                    ● Will the second party have to give its written approval to the specific conditions
                                    under which confidential information is disclosed by the first party to a third
                                    party, or is it sufficient that such disclosures are made under conditions of
                                    confidentiality no less onerous than those set out in this document?
                                    ● Should the Provider be required to act in good faith in relation to confidential
                                    information?
                                    ● Should the first party be placed under an obligation to only use the information
                                    disclosed for a defined purpose?
                                    Clause 12.2
                                    ● To whom may the first party disclose confidential information supplied by the
                                    second party?
                                    ● Should disclosures made under this provision be prohibited unless there is a "need
                                    to know"?
                                    Clause 12.3
                                    ● Should the first party be free to disclose all information received from third
                                    parties in circumstances where the first party has no reason to believe that there
                                    has been a breach of a confidentiality obligation?
                                    Clause 12.5
                                    ● Will the confidentiality obligations in this section continue indefinitely, or
                                    will they come to an end at some point following termination of the contract?
                                    ● For what period following termination will the confidentiality obligations
                                    continue?
                                    Clause 13: Data protection
                                    Will the Provider process personal data on behalf of the Customer?
                                    This provision is designed to help the parties to a data processing arrangement to
                                    comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in force from 25 May
                                    2018.
                                    In addition to a set of specific requirements, the GDPR includes a general
                                    obligation on data controllers to ensure compliance:
                                    "Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller
                                    shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate
                                    technical and organizational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the
                                    requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data
                                    subject." (Article 28(1))
                                    One aspect of ensuring compliance is the use of an appropriate written contract:
                                    "Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under
                                    Union or Member State law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the
                                    controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the
                                    nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of
                                    data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller." (Article 28(3))
                                    The drafting in these provisions closely reflects the language of the GDPR.

                                    Clause 13.1
                                    Optional element.
                                    Clause 13.2
                                    Optional element.
                                    Clause 13.6
                                    Article 28(2)(a) of the GDPR provides that the controller-processor contract must
                                    stipulate that the controller "processes the personal data only on documented
                                    instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal
                                    data to a third country or an international organization ... ".
                                    Clause 13.7
                                    Optional element.
                                    Clause 13.8
                                    Optional element.
                                    The final section of Article 28(3) of the GDPR reads: "With regard to point (h) of
                                    the first subparagraph, the processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in
                                    its opinion, an instruction infringes this Regulation or other Union or Member State
                                    data protection provisions."
                                    The cross-reference in the legislation is presumably a mistake, and should point at
                                    Article 28(3)(a).
                                    In any case, it is not clear from the legislation whether this provision needs to be
                                    part of the processing contract.
                                    Clause 13.9
                                    Article 28(2)(a) of the GDPR provides that the controller-processor contract must
                                    stipulate an exception to the general rule that personal data may only be processed
                                    on the data controller's instructions: " ... unless required to do so by Union or
                                    Member State law to which the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor
                                    shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless that
                                    law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest".
                                    Note the distinction between "Union or Member State law" in the GDPR and "applicable
                                    law" in the draft provision. There is a possibility of conflict between legal
                                    obligations here. Similarly, if applicable law prohibits the notification to the
                                    controller of legally-mandated processing, then in principle that might not be on
                                    "important grounds of public interest".
                                    Clause 13.10
                                    Article 28(3)(b) of the GDPR provides that the controller-processor contract must
                                    stipulate that the processor "ensures that persons authorised to process the
                                    personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an
                                    appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality".
                                    Clause 13.11
                                    Article 28(3)(c) of the GDPR provides that the controller-processor contract must
                                    stipulate that the processor "takes all measures required pursuant to Article 32".
                                    Article 32 provides that:
                                    "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the
                                    nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying
                                    likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the
                                    controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and
                                    organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,
                                    including inter alia as appropriate: (a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of
                                    personal data; (b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity,
                                    availability and resilience of processing systems and services; (c) the ability to
                                    restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event
                                    of a physical or technical incident; (d) a process for regularly testing, assessing
                                    and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for
                                    ensuring the security of the processing.
                                    2. In assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be taken in
                                    particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from
                                    accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or
                                    access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
                                    3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an
                                    approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an
                                    element by which to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in
                                    paragraph 1 of this Article.
                                    4. The controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that any natural person
                                    acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to
                                    personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller,
                                    unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law."
                                    Clause 13.12
                                    Article 28(2) of the GDPR provides that: "The processor shall not engage another
                                    processor without prior specific or general written authorisation of the controller.
                                    In the case of general written authorisation, the processor shall inform the
                                    controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other
                                    processors, thereby giving the controller the opportunity to object to such
                                    changes".
                                    Article 28(4) provides that: "Where a processor engages another processor for
                                    carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same
                                    data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between
                                    the controller and the processor as referred to in paragraph 3 shall be imposed on
                                    that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member
                                    State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate
                                    technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet
                                    the requirements of this Regulation. Where that other processor fails to fulfil its
                                    data protection obligations, the initial processor shall remain fully liable to the
                                    controller for the performance of that other processor's obligations."
                                    Article 28(3)(d) provides that the controller-processor contract should stipulate
                                    that the processor "respects the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 for
                                    engaging another processor".

                                    Optional element.
                                    Clause 13.14
                                    Article 28(3)(e) of the GDPR provides that controller-processor contracts must
                                    stipulate that the processor "taking into account the nature of the processing,
                                    assists the controller by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar
                                    as this is possible, for the fulfillment of the controller's obligation to respond
                                    to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III".
                                    Clause 13.15
                                    Article 28(3)(f) of the GDPR provides that the controller-processor contract must
                                    stipulate that the processor "assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the
                                    obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 taking into account the nature of
                                    processing and the information available to the processor".
                                    Clause 13.16
                                    Optional element.
                                    Article 33(2) of the GDPR provides that: "The processor shall notify the controller
                                    without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach."
                                    No specific time period for these notifications is specified in the GDPR. The
                                    Article 29 Data Protection Working Party guidance on notifications states that the
                                    data processor's awareness of a breach fixes the data controller with awareness. If
                                    that is correct, the period for notification to the controller should of course be
                                    less than 72 hours, or the controller will not be in a position to comply with its
                                    own notification obligations.
                                    Clause 13.17
                                    Article 28(3)(h): the contract must require that the data processor "makes available
                                    to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the
                                    obligations laid down in this Article...".
                                    The default text here is wider, also covering compliance with any supplemental
                                    contractual clauses and relevant data protection legislation.
                                    Clause 13.18
                                    Article 28(3)(g) of the GDPR requires that the controller-processor contract
                                    stipulates that the processor "at the choice of the controller, deletes or returns
                                    all the personal data to the controller after the end of the provision of services
                                    relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless Union or Member State law
                                    requires storage of the personal data".
                                    NB this is slightly different from the suggested contract provision, which refers
                                    instead to "applicable law". Clearly, there could be a conflict here between the
                                    requirements of the law of a non-EU jurisdiction and the requirements of EU law.
                                    Clause 13.19
                                    Article 28(3)(h): the contract must require that the data processor "allow for and
                                    contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the controller or another
                                    auditor mandated by the controller".
                                    The suggested qualification to the scope of audits is not expressly permitted in the
                                    legislation.
                                    Clause 13.20
                                    Optional element.
                                    Consider whether additional rights of termination may be required in the event that
                                    the parties are unable to agree a suitable variation.

                                    Optional element.

                                    ● What types of advice should be specified here?
                                    Clause 16: Limitations and exclusions of liability
                                    Contractual limitations and exclusions of liability are regulated and controlled by
                                    law, and the courts may rule that particular limitations and exclusions of liability
                                    in contracts are unenforceable.
                                    The courts are particularly likely to intervene where a party is seeking to rely on
                                    a limitation or exclusion of liability in its standard terms and conditions, but
                                    will also sometimes intervene where a term has been individually negotiated. The
                                    courts may be more likely to rule that provisions excluding liability, as opposed to
                                    those merely limiting liability, are unenforceable.
                                    If there is a risk that any particular limitation or exclusion of liability will be
                                    found to be unenforceable by the courts, that provision should be drafted as an
                                    independent term, and be numbered separately from the other provisions. It may
                                    improve the chances of a limitation or exclusion of liability being found to be
                                    enforceable if the party seeking to rely upon it specifically drew it to the
                                    attention of the other party before the contract was entered into.
                                    Exclusions and limitations of liability in UK contracts are primarily regulated by
                                    the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 ("UCTA").
                                    Contracts regulated by UCTA cannot exclude or restrict a party's liability for death
                                    or personal injury resulting from negligence (Section 2(1), UCTA). Except insofar as
                                    the relevant term satisfies the requirements of reasonableness, such contracts
                                    cannot exclude or restrict liability: (i) for negligence (which includes a breach of
                                    an express or implied contractual obligation to take reasonable care or exercise
                                    reasonable skill) (Section 2(2), UCTA); or (ii) for misrepresentation (Section 3,
                                    Misrepresentation Act 1967). In addition, if a contract is regulated by UCTA, and
                                    one of the parties is dealing on the other's written standard terms of business,
                                    then except insofar as the relevant contractual term satisfies the requirements of
                                    reasonableness the other party cannot: (i) exclude or restrict his liability in
                                    respect of a breach of contract; or (ii) claim to be entitled to render a
                                    contractual performance substantially different from that which was reasonably
                                    expected of him; or (iii) claim to be entitled, in respect of the whole or any part
                                    of his contractual obligation, to render no contractual performance at all (see
                                    Section 3, UCTA).
                                    UCTA includes various other restrictions, particularly in the case of contracts for
                                    the sale of goods and contracts under which possession or ownership of goods passes.
                                    If you wish to try to limit/exclude for liability in respect of reckless,
                                    deliberate, personal and/or repudiatory breaches of contract, you should specify
                                    this in relation to the relevant provision. In many circumstances, however, the
                                    courts will find these types of limitations and exclusions to be unenforceable.
                                    Somewhat different rules apply to limitations of liability in contracts with
                                    consumers, and these provisions should not be used in relation to such contracts.
                                    These guidance notes provide a very incomplete and basic overview of a complex
                                    subject. Accordingly, you should take legal advice if you may wish to rely upon a
                                    limitation or exclusion of liability.
